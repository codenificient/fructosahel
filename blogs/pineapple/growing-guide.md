# Complete Pineapple Growing Guide for the Sahel Region

## Introduction

Pineapple (*Ananas comosus*) is a tropical fruit that can be successfully cultivated in the Sahel region with proper irrigation management. While the Sahel's hot, semi-arid climate presents challenges, pineapples are surprisingly adaptable and can thrive with the right techniques.

## Climate Considerations

### Sahel Climate Profile
- **Temperature**: 25-35°C ideal, can tolerate up to 40°C
- **Rainfall**: Requires supplemental irrigation (natural rainfall insufficient)
- **Humidity**: Low humidity acceptable with adequate watering
- **Sunlight**: Full sun preferred, partial shade during extreme heat

### Adaptation Strategies
1. Use shade cloth when temperatures exceed 40°C
2. Morning irrigation to reduce heat stress
3. Heavy mulching for moisture retention
4. Windbreaks against Harmattan winds

## Recommended Varieties

| Variety | Characteristics | Best For |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Smooth Cayenne | Large fruit, good flavor, drought tolerant | Export, processing |
| Queen | Sweet, small fruit | Local markets |
| MD-2 (Gold) | High sugar, low acid | Premium export |
| Sugarloaf | Cylindrical, white flesh | Local preference |

## Planting Guide

### Site Selection
- Well-drained sandy-loam soil
- pH 4.5-6.5 (acidic preferred)
- Avoid waterlogged areas
- Protected from strong winds

### Soil Preparation
1. Clear and level the land
2. Add organic matter (compost, manure)
3. Create raised beds for drainage
4. Apply sulfur to lower pH if needed

### Propagation Material
- **Suckers**: Best quality, faster fruiting
- **Crowns**: From harvested fruit, slower but free
- **Slips**: Side shoots, good balance

### Planting Procedure
1. Cure propagules in shade for 1 week
2. Plant at 30cm depth
3. Spacing: 30cm x 60cm (double row system)
4. Density: 50,000-60,000 plants/hectare

## Growing Calendar (Sahel)

| Month | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| Jan-Feb | Prepare beds, apply organic matter |
| Mar-Apr | Plant suckers/crowns, set up irrigation |
| May-Jun | Monitor growth, weed control, first fertilizer |
| Jul-Aug | Rainy season care, disease monitoring |
| Sep-Oct | Prepare for flower induction |
| Nov-Dec | Ethylene treatment, fruit development |

## Water Management

### Irrigation Requirements
- **Weekly**: 25-50mm during dry season
- **Method**: Drip irrigation recommended
- **Timing**: Early morning or evening
- **Rainy season**: Reduce or stop irrigation

### Water Conservation
- Mulch with dried grass or crop residues
- Use water-harvesting techniques
- Install drip systems for efficiency
- Monitor soil moisture regularly

## Fertilization Program

### NPK Requirements
| Stage | N | P | K |
|-------|---|---|---|
| Vegetative | High | Medium | Medium |
| Pre-flowering | Low | High | High |
| Fruiting | Medium | Low | High |

### Application Schedule
1. **Month 2**: 10g NPK 12-12-12 per plant
2. **Month 4**: 10g NPK + micronutrients
3. **Month 6**: 10g NPK 15-5-30
4. **Month 8**: Foliar potassium spray

### Organic Options
- Compost: 2kg per plant annually
- Manure tea: Monthly foliar spray
- Wood ash: Potassium source

## Pest and Disease Management

### Common Pests
| Pest | Symptoms | Control |
|------|----------|---------|
| Mealybugs | White waxy coating | Neem oil spray |
| Pineapple scale | Brown bumps on leaves | Soap spray |
| Nematodes | Stunted growth | Crop rotation |
| Fruit flies | Fruit damage | Traps, early harvest |

### Disease Prevention
- Use disease-free planting material
- Avoid waterlogging
- Remove infected plants
- Apply fungicides preventatively

## Flower Induction

### Natural Flowering
- Usually 12-18 months after planting
- Triggered by short days and cool nights

### Forced Flowering (Ethylene Treatment)
1. Mix calcium carbide in water
2. Apply 50ml per plant center
3. Do at night when cool
4. Flowering in 8-10 weeks

## Harvesting

### Maturity Signs
- 1/3 to 2/3 of fruit turning yellow
- Sweet aroma at base
- "Full" sound when tapped
- Shell eyes flatten

### Harvest Technique
1. Cut with sharp knife
2. Leave 2-3cm stem attached
3. Handle carefully (avoid bruising)
4. Harvest in cool morning hours

### Expected Yield
- First crop: 60-70 tons/hectare
- Ratoon crop: 50-60 tons/hectare
- Fruit weight: 1.5-2.5 kg

## Post-Harvest Handling

### Storage
- Room temperature: 1-2 weeks
- 8-12°C: Up to 4 weeks
- Avoid temperatures below 7°C (chilling injury)

### Market Preparation
- Grade by size and maturity
- Remove damaged fruit
- Clean but don't wash
- Pack carefully for transport

## Economics (Sahel)

### Investment (per hectare)
| Item | Cost (XOF) |
|------|-----------|
| Land preparation | 200,000 |

| Irrigation setup | 1,000,000 |
| Fertilizers (year 1) | 300,000 |
| Labor | 500,000 |
| **Total Year 1** | **3,500,000** |

### Expected Returns
- First harvest (18 months): 60,000 kg
- Price: 500-1,000 XOF/kg
- Revenue: 30,000,000-60,000,000 XOF
- ROI: 100-200% after first harvest

## Tips for Success in the Sahel

1. **Water is Critical**: Invest in reliable irrigation
2. **Mulch Heavily**: Reduces water needs by 40%
3. **Protect from Heat**: Shade during extreme temperatures
4. **Choose Right Variety**: Smooth Cayenne for drought tolerance
5. **Start Small**: Learn before scaling up
6. **Plan Marketing**: Secure buyers before harvest
7. **Keep Records**: Track inputs and yields
